# What Chat Bots can do for us?

2.**Chatbots Create Engagement**

Chatbots are the future of brand engagement. Engaged customers are more likely to proceed to the bottom of your sales funnel faster.

Did you know that a single chatbot can perform the task of several customer service agents? Sure it can. Chatbots are cost-effective customer service solutions for brands in any capacity with a high or low budget

**4. Businesses Use Chatbots to Handle Uncomplicated Tasks**

Complex questions that need serious analysis are not meant for chatbots. Using chatbots to answer simple questions and engaging customers with offers can be effective

**5. Chatbots are Good, But They Can’t Completely Replace Humans**

For example, a customer who wants to change his/her password, logs into your website and next, the chatbot shows up: “Do you need help with anything?” and you reply “Yes, I want to change my password.”

Then chatbot will take the same information and gives you the step-by-step process for changing your password successfully. Simple questions like that are pretty much good for chatbots.

**6. Chatbots Allow Brands to Offer 24/7 Customer Service Support**

Customers are happy to get the information they need when they need it. But a customer representative will most likely not be present all the time.

That’s where chatbots come in handy. A chatbot is always there and very active at every time of the day ready to be engaged.

Chatbots can afford to keep your customers happy, give them the best services, and most importantly, there’s always an option to call a real person in case you aren’t getting the answers you’re after.
