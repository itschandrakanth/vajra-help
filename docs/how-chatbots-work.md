### **How chatbots work**

Chatbot is also about simulating conversation between humans, so there are fun aspect of making a chatbot, like adding personalities.

Now, let’s discuss how a chatbot process human language. When you type some text into your chatbot, generally it looks for two things: intents and entities of the sentence. **Intent** is the broad description of what a user is trying to say and **Entity** is data classification from information the user provided. 

## Intents and Entities:

While **intents** allow your agent to understand the motivation behind a particular user input, **entities** are used to pick out specific pieces of information that your users mention—anything from street addresses to product names and amounts with units.

**Intent:**

Within a **chatbot**, **intent** refers to the goal the customer has in mind when typing in a question or comment. While **entity** refers to the modifier the customer uses to describe their issue, **intent** is what they really mean.

Intent is a critical factor in chatbot functionality because the chatbot’s ability to parse intent is what ultimately determines the success of the interaction. In order for a chatbot to be good at this, it must:

1.Be programmed well and trained with a useful model involving a lot of training data

2.Take advantage of machine learning to constantly advance and improve

An _intent_ is the user’s intention. For example, if a user types “show me yesterday’s financial news”, the user’s intent is to retrieve a list of financial headlines. Intents are given a name, often a verb and a noun, such as “showNews”.

**Entity:**

Within a chatbot, an entity, or slot, modifies user intent. Chatbot entities are connected to knowledge repositories in order to provide more personal and accurate responses on user search. An entity in a chatbot is used to add values to the search intent.

Entities can be fields, data, or text describing just about anything — a time, place, person, item, number, etc. Using natural language processing (NLP), chatbots can extract entities from entries that users type in in order to turn around accurate recommendations and answers.

An _entity_ modifies an intent. For example, if a user types “show me yesterday’s financial news”, the entities are “yesterday” and “financial”. Entities are given a name, such as “dateTime” and “newsType”. Entities are sometimes referred to as _slots_.
