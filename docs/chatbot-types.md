## Different Types of Chat Bots:

Classification of chatbots depends on two things -
1.	Problem you’re trying to solve.
2.	Functionalities you’re trying to incorporate

**Support Chat Bot:**
Designed to solve a specific problem, support chatbots require context awareness, a personality and multi-turn capability. They should be able to walk a user through a business process and answer wide range of FAQs. Most of the support chatbots use deep learning and natural language processing to perform actions. Speech recognition is optional for support chatbots.

Use-cases of support chatbots

 - Customer service bot
 - E-commerce bot with recommendation engine capability
 - Food ordering bots
 - FAQ bots

**Skills Chatbot:**
It’s a single-turn-type chatbot that doesn’t require much of contextual awareness. It can just follow a command to perform an action. For example, a skills chatbot can follow the command ‘switch on the lights’ readily, with its speech recognition functionality. A skills chatbot requires powerful NLP features as well as must be quick to work.

**Assistant Bots:**
Assistant bots, like support bots, need to be good at conversations and answering FAQs. They must also be entertaining to maintain user interest. The most successful example of assistant bots is Siri by Apple, which can not only assist the user with several tasks like fetching the news, making a google search, setting reminders etc but also responds in a funny way if it doesn’t understand the query.

**Transactional Bots:**
These bots can be roughly classified into assistant bots as they often act on behalf of humans to perform various transactions. For example, placing an order, making a reservation etc. Several custom solutions for transactional bots are possible, helping users increase their productivity as the bot interacts with external systems to perform transactions.
Transactional bots find use in several industries just like support chatbots.

**Informational and Information Gathering Bots:**
Both types of bots help either in collecting or in distributing information. For example, a news bot (an informational bot) can send push notifications or offer news recommendations to users with use of AI and text classification technologies.
Information gathering bots can act as research assistants by extracting as much information as possible either from a human or from an internet resource like a website or an e-book.
Information gathering bots are very relevant in education and corporate training sector as well as in digital marketing sector for research-based tasks.
