# Contacts Management 
## Import Leads: 

- Please Download the sample CSV and rearrage with your own data without changing column order and column names
## Phone number issues:
We have 2 choices while updating the csv file with phone numbers
- ✅ either upload the contacts without country code
- ✅ or upload the contacts with country code along with + (important)
- ❌ Phone number is not valid if it is uploaded with country code without + sign

## Example:

✅ 98999 99999

❌ 91 98999 99999

✅ +91 98999 99999
